### Explanation how the text contact is bml
BML has its own short code, as an example its 2022 and what the perpetrator was trying to do was they had registered their own shortcode. When they registered the shortcode its under BML so your Messaging app will think its the same contact if you had recieved any messages from BML before so the messaging app will put the new message under the previous messages making you think its actually BML who is sending you this link.
